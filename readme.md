# Domain Adaptation-Based Deep Learning Model for Forecasting and Diagnosis of Glaucoma Disease

**Purpose:** To develop a deep learning-based domain adaptation model (GDA) to detect and forecast glaucoma using retinal fundus photographs and to validate the model using two independent datasets.

**Datasets:**
We developed a novel, deep domain adaptation model, named Glaucoma Domain Adaptation (GDA), and applied it to three different ocular datasets: the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) dataset for training the model, and ACRIMA and RIM-ONE datasets for testing the model. Fundus images in the OHTS were collected from subjects in 22 different centers in the U.S. using different cameras, with considerable variability in image quality, resolution, and characteristics.
